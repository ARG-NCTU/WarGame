Implement a class with an action method which takes the same arguments as shown by sample_bot.py. You will take two arguments country_status and world_state. Return a dictionary (we call the Action) with the following keys.

country_status

{
    "Alive": [A boolean],
    "Filename": [A string],
    "Health": [A non-negative integer],
    "ID": [A unique integer],
    "Kills": [A list of country IDs]
    "Name": [A string],
    "Resources": [A non-negative integer],
    "Nukes": [A non-negative integer]
}

{
    "active_weapons": [An array of Active Weapon dictionaries]

    "events": [An array of Event dictionaries]
    "alive_players": [A set of integers corresponding to country IDs]
}
