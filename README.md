# WarGame Competition
Our goal is to make bots that compete in wargames using Python and game theory. You will be provided with sample code to customize as you wish.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an understanding of intermediate Python. This includes variable scoping, classes, and various keywords (break, return, for-else, etc).

- Become comfortable using standard and non-standard libraries to produce a useful program.

## Tools and Technologies

[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as the language of choice.
